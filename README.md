# sample-signup-form

[Live Demo](https://ashish-krishna-k.github.io/sample-signup-form/)

This is a simple Sign-up form built using pure HTML and CSS (and a little bit of JavaScript for validation) as part of a project for The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML&CSS course.

*The project was initially completed during my first run of The Odin Project curriculum. I am now going through the curriculum a second time with more advanced knowledge and skills and reworking all the previous projects to test myself. This time I have chose to use typescript for the projects i'm revisiting*

The project is very simple with a basic sign up form and simple validation. For validation I have utilized Javascript(typescript in this case) to simply check if the value of "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields are matching.
